                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. 
                It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexiblity for developers to take it in a bunch of different diretions.
                JavaScriptlives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class = "subcontentbullet"><span>Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffeem the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.  </li>
                    <li class = "subcontentbullet"><span>Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10</li>
                    <li class = "subcontentbullet"><span>Data Type</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -true or false; null -null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name:'Jane', last name:'Doe'}</li>
                    <li class = "subcontentbullet"><span>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use coniditional statements in your code </li>
                    <li class = "subcontentbullet"><span>Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li class = "subcontentbullet"><span>Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the lefs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a tone more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
